### Date Picker Sheet Implementation Learnings

When implementing sheet presentations in SwiftUI, especially with date pickers:

1. **Sheet Presentation Hierarchy**
   - Sheets should be presented from parent views rather than child components
   - This ensures proper navigation stack and presentation handling
   - Prevents conflicts with other sheet presentations

2. **Component Design**
   - Create dedicated view components for reusable UI elements (e.g., DatePickerView)
   - Keep state management at appropriate levels
   - Use bindings to pass state between parent and child views

3. **Presentation Timing**
   - Be cautious of presentation conflicts when multiple sheets could be shown
   - Consider adding delays if needed to prevent presentation conflicts
   - Always handle dismissal properly to maintain view state

4. **Debugging Tips**
   - Use strategic print statements to track state changes
   - Monitor presentation state changes
   - Watch for multiple presentation attempts
   - Check navigation stack interactions

5. **Best Practices**
   - Maintain separation of concerns
   - Keep view components focused and reusable
   - Handle state at appropriate levels in view hierarchy
   - Use proper SwiftUI view modifiers (.sheet, .navigationStack)
