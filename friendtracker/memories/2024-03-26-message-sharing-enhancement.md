# Message Sharing Enhancement

## Context
The hangout sharing feature included a calendar link in the shared message, but this created a poor user experience as the link was not functioning as expected and made the message look cluttered.

## Decision
We decided to:
1. Remove the calendar link from the shared message
2. Simplify the message format to focus on essential details (date, activity, location)
3. Improve the message sheet presentation with adjustable height
4. Keep the friendly tone with emojis and a welcoming message

## Technical Changes
- Removed `calendarEventURL` usage from the message text in `HangoutCard`
- Updated message sheet presentation detents to `[.height(400), .large]`
- Added visible drag indicator for better UX
- Maintained clear formatting with emojis for date (🗓), activity (🎯), and location (📍)

## Impact
- Cleaner, more readable messages
- Better user experience with simplified content
- More reliable sharing functionality
- Improved message sheet interaction with adjustable height

## Future Considerations
- Could explore alternative ways to share calendar events
- Might consider adding more customization options for message content
- Could investigate integration with other sharing methods
