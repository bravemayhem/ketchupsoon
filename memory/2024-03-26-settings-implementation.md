# Settings Implementation - March 26, 2024

## Overview
Added a new settings interface to the app, providing a centralized location for managing app preferences and user data.

## Implementation Details

### Navigation
- Added settings gear icon to the left side of all navigation bars using `ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading)`
- Settings view is presented as a sheet when the gear icon is tapped
- Used `@State private var showingSettings` in `NavigationTab` to manage sheet presentation

### Settings View Structure
Created a new `SettingsView` with three main sections:

1. **Profile Section**
   - Profile Settings navigation link
   - Uses `person.circle` SF Symbol

2. **App Settings Section**
   - Notifications settings link
   - Calendar Integration link
   - Uses appropriate SF Symbols for visual consistency

3. **Data Management Section**
   - Clear All Data option with destructive styling
   - Confirmation alert before data deletion

### Files Modified
- `ContentView.swift`: Updated `NavigationTab` to include settings button
- Created new file: `Features/Settings/Views/SettingsView.swift`

### Design Decisions
- Used Form-based layout for settings to match iOS conventions
- Implemented sheet presentation for settings to maintain context
- Added confirmation alert for destructive actions
- Used SF Symbols for consistent visual language

### Future Considerations
- Implement actual functionality for Profile Settings
- Add notification preferences management
- Implement calendar integration settings
- Consider adding app theme customization
- Add data backup/restore functionality

## Technical Notes
- Settings view uses `@Environment(\.dismiss)` for sheet dismissal
- Leverages SwiftData context for potential data operations
- Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines for settings organization
