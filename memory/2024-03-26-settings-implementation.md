# Settings Implementation - March 26, 2024

## Overview
Added a new settings interface to the app, providing a centralized location for managing app preferences and user data. Integrated existing calendar functionality into the settings interface and fixed Google Calendar authentication persistence.

## Implementation Details

### Navigation
- Added settings gear icon to the left side of all navigation bars using `ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading)`
- Settings view is presented as a sheet when the gear icon is tapped
- Used `@State private var showingSettings` in `NavigationTab` to manage sheet presentation

### Settings View Structure
Created a new `SettingsView` with three main sections:

1. **Profile Section**
   - Profile Settings navigation link
   - Uses `person.circle` SF Symbol

2. **App Settings Section**
   - Notifications settings link
   - Calendar Integration link with enhanced functionality
   - Uses appropriate SF Symbols for visual consistency

3. **Data Management Section**
   - Clear All Data option with destructive styling
   - Confirmation alert before data deletion

### Calendar Integration
Integrated existing `CalendarManager` with the following improvements:
- Status indicators showing connection state for both Apple and Google calendars
- Direct access to calendar authorization flows
- List view of all connected calendars with their sources
- Clear visual feedback for connected status
- Automatic calendar sync for hangouts scheduling

### Google Calendar Authentication
Enhanced Google Calendar integration with proper persistence:
- Added session restoration in `setupGoogleCalendar`
- Implemented proper error handling for authentication
- Added explicit sign-out functionality
- Enhanced state management for Google Calendar connection
- Added visual feedback for connection status in UI
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Files Modified
- `ContentView.swift`: Updated `NavigationTab` to include settings button
- Created new file: `Features/Settings/Views/SettingsView.swift`
- Created new file: `Features/Settings/Views/CalendarIntegrationView.swift`
- Updated `Info.plist` with calendar permissions
- Modified: `Features/SchedulingFeat/Models/CalendarManager.swift` for authentication fixes

### Design Decisions
- Used Form-based layout for settings to match iOS conventions
- Implemented sheet presentation for settings to maintain context
- Added confirmation alert for destructive actions
- Used SF Symbols for consistent visual language
- Leveraged existing `CalendarManager` for calendar integration
- Provided clear visual feedback for connection states
- Implemented proper authentication state persistence

### Technical Integration
- Utilized `@StateObject private var calendarManager = CalendarManager()`
- Implemented proper async/await calls for calendar permissions
- Handled both Apple and Google calendar authorization flows
- Displayed real-time connection status
- Managed calendar permissions through Info.plist declarations
- Added proper error handling for Google authentication
- Implemented session restoration for persistent sign-in

### Future Considerations
- Implement actual functionality for Profile Settings
- Add notification preferences management
- Consider adding app theme customization
- Add data backup/restore functionality
- Enhance calendar sync settings with more granular controls
- Add calendar event conflict resolution
- Implement calendar sync frequency options
- Add offline mode handling for calendar integration
- Implement multi-account Google Calendar support

## Technical Notes
- Settings view uses `@Environment(\.dismiss)` for sheet dismissal
- Leverages SwiftData context for potential data operations
- Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines for settings organization
- Uses existing calendar integration infrastructure
- Maintains proper state management for calendar connections
- Implements proper error handling for authentication flows
- Uses async/await for all network and authentication operations
