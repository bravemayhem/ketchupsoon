# Calendar Optimization Implementation
Date: February 1, 2024

## Context
The calendar view in the app was experiencing performance issues where events would refresh and show a loading state each time the user opened the calendar or changed dates. This created a suboptimal user experience with unnecessary loading flickers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Implemented Smart Caching System
- Added date-based event caching using ISO8601 formatted dates as keys
- Cache expires after 5 minutes to ensure data freshness
- Cache structure:
```swift
@Published private(set) var eventCache: [String: (date: Date, events: [CalendarEvent])] = [:]
```

### 2. Proactive Event Loading
- Events are now preloaded in three scenarios:
  1. App launch
  2. App returning to foreground (using `scenePhase`)
  3. Calendar view opening (as fallback)
- Implemented in `friendtrackerApp`:
```swift
.onChange(of: scenePhase) { _, newPhase in
    if newPhase == .active {
        Task {
            await calendarManager.preloadTodaysEvents()
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Improved Loading States
- Only show loading indicator when no events are available
- Keep showing existing events while fetching new ones
- Immediate display of cached events when available

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive debug logging with emojis for better tracking
- Log events include:
  - üóì Event preloading
  - ‚úÖ Cache hits
  - üîÑ Cache refreshes
  - üìÖ Event counts
  - ‚ùå Authorization issues

## Technical Details

### Cache Implementation
- Uses date-based keys for efficient lookup
- Includes timestamp for expiration checking
- Thread-safe with MainActor protection
- Automatic cleanup on app relaunch

### Performance Optimizations
- Minimized UI updates during loading
- Reduced unnecessary network calls
- Smart cache expiration (5-minute window)
- Efficient date comparison for cache validation

## Testing Notes

### Test Cases to Verify
1. Initial app launch
   - Should preload today's events
   - Should show events immediately when opening calendar

2. Background/Foreground Transition
   - Should refresh events when returning to foreground
   - Should maintain cached events during brief background periods

3. Date Navigation
   - Should use cache for previously viewed dates
   - Should smoothly load new dates without UI flicker

4. Calendar Authorization
   - Should handle both Apple and Google calendar states
   - Should properly cache events from both sources

### Edge Cases to Test
- Network connectivity changes
- Calendar permission changes
- Date boundary conditions
- Large number of events
- Multiple calendar sources

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Enhanced Caching**
   - Consider longer cache duration for past dates
   - Implement predictive caching for upcoming dates
   - Add cache persistence across app launches

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch load multiple days at once
   - Implement progressive loading for long time ranges
   - Add background refresh capability

3. **User Experience**
   - Add pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Show last update timestamp
   - Add manual refresh button
   - Implement offline mode with cached data

4. **Calendar Integration**
   - Support for more calendar providers
   - Better handling of recurring events
   - Calendar availability indicators
   - Multiple calendar selection

### Known Limitations
1. Cache expires after 5 minutes (may be too frequent)
2. No offline persistence of cached events
3. Limited to current day preloading
4. No background refresh capability

## Impact
- Significantly improved calendar view performance
- Reduced unnecessary loading states
- Better user experience with immediate event display
- More efficient use of calendar APIs
- Reduced network usage through smart caching

## Lessons Learned
1. Importance of proactive data loading
2. Balance between data freshness and performance
3. Value of comprehensive logging during development
4. Need for graceful handling of loading states
5. Benefits of singleton pattern for shared resources
