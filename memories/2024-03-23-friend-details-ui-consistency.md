# Friend Details UI Consistency Improvements

## Context
The friend details section in both existing friend views and onboarding views had inconsistent styling for labels and input fields. The city field in particular had different styling from other fields like Name and Phone Number.

## Changes Made
- Standardized label styling across all fields (Name, Phone, City)
- Updated all labels to use black text (AppColors.label)
- Added consistent "Not set" placeholder text for empty fields
- Unified text alignment (labels left-aligned, values right-aligned)
- Improved visual hierarchy with secondary colors for values and placeholders

## Files Modified
- `ketchupsoon/Shared/Components/CitySearchField.swift`
- `ketchupsoon/Features/FriendDetail/Components/Atomic/FriendDetailComponents.swift`

## Visual Impact
- More professional and polished appearance
- Better visual hierarchy between labels and values
- Improved readability through consistent text alignment
- Clear indication of optional fields through standardized "Not set" placeholder

## Technical Details
Used SwiftUI's HStack with consistent spacing and alignment modifiers. Standardized the use of AppColors.label for labels and AppColors.secondaryLabel for values and placeholders.
