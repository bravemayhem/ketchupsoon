# Fixing ContactView Presentation Issues

## Problem
The ContactView was experiencing several issues:
1. Abrupt closing/dismissal on first attempt to open
2. Multiple simultaneous presentation attempts
3. Blank screen instead of contact details
4. Delegate being deallocated immediately
5. Poor loading state feedback

## Root Causes
1. Multiple presentation attempts due to SwiftUI view lifecycle
2. Weak delegate reference being deallocated
3. Race conditions in presentation timing
4. Lack of proper state management
5. No visual feedback during loading

## Solution

### State Management
```swift
// Static tracking to prevent multiple presentations
private static var isCurrentlyPresenting = false

// Strong reference to delegate
@State private var delegate: ContactViewDelegate?

// Loading and lifecycle states
@State private var isLoading = true
@State private var hasLoadedContact = false
```

### Presentation Flow
1. Show loading indicator while fetching contact
2. Prevent multiple presentations with static flag
3. Use MainActor for UI updates
4. Maintain strong reference to delegate
5. Clean up on disappear

### Key Code Changes

#### Loading State
```swift
var body: some View {
    Group {
        if isLoading {
            ZStack {
                Color.clear
                ProgressView("Loading contact...")
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
            }
        } else if let error = error {
            Text(error)
                .foregroundColor(.red)
        } else if contact != nil {
            Color.clear
        }
    }
}
```

#### Presentation Guards
```swift
guard !ContactView.isCurrentlyPresenting else {
    print("üëÅ [Position: \(position)] Another presentation is in progress, dismissing")
    isPresented = false
    return
}
```

#### Delegate Management
```swift
// Create and store delegate
delegate = ContactViewDelegate(onDismiss: {
    isPresented = false
    ContactView.isCurrentlyPresenting = false
})
contactVC.delegate = delegate

// Clean up
.onDisappear {
    ContactView.isCurrentlyPresenting = false
    delegate = nil
}
```

## Learnings
1. SwiftUI sheets can trigger multiple presentation attempts
2. UIKit delegates need strong references when used with SwiftUI
3. Static flags can help prevent multiple presentations
4. Loading states improve user experience
5. Proper cleanup is essential for view lifecycle

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using UIViewControllerRepresentable for tighter integration
2. Add transition animations between states
3. Improve error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Consider caching contact data
5. Add loading progress indicators

## Testing
Key scenarios to test:
1. First-time presentation
2. Rapid open/close attempts
3. Contact access denied
4. Network connectivity issues
5. Contact not found
6. Editing and saving changes
