# Implementation Memories

## Duplicate Friend Prevention

### Overview
Added validation to prevent duplicate friends from being added to the app, either through manual entry or contact import.

### Implementation Details
- Located in `FriendDetail.OnboardingViewModel`
- Uses two types of validation:
  1. Contact identifier check for imported contacts
  2. Case-insensitive name comparison for all friends

### Technical Notes
- SwiftData predicate limitations required performing case-insensitive name comparison in memory
- Contact identifier check uses direct predicate comparison
- Error handling uses custom `FriendError` enum with descriptive messages
- Validation happens before friend creation to ensure data integrity

### User Experience
- Shows clear error messages when duplicates are detected
- Prevents accidental duplicate entries
- Maintains data quality by ensuring each friend is unique

### Future Considerations
- If the friend list grows very large, may need to optimize the in-memory name comparison
- Could add fuzzy matching for similar names as a warning (not blocking)
- Might want to add ability to merge duplicate entries if found
