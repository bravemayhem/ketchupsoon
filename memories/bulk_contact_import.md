# Bulk Contact Import Implementation

## Overview
The bulk contact import feature allows users to efficiently import multiple contacts from their address book into the app, with options for both detailed onboarding and quick import.

## Implementation Details

### Contact Selection
- Uses `CNContactStore` to access system contacts
- Displays contacts in a searchable list with profile images
- Shows contact details (name, phone, city) in list items
- Visually indicates already imported contacts
- Supports multi-select with checkmarks

### Import Flows
1. **Detailed Onboarding Flow**
   - Shows progress bar with current friend count
   - Allows individual customization of each contact
   - Supports setting additional details like:
     - Tags
     - Catch-up frequency
     - Last seen date
     - Connect soon flag
   - Maintains state between contacts using `currentOnboardingIndex`
   - Forces view refresh using `.id` modifier

2. **Quick Import Flow ("Skip All")**
   - Bypasses individual customization
   - Performs bulk import with basic contact details
   - Includes duplicate checking for data integrity
   - More efficient for large imports

### Duplicate Prevention
- Checks for existing contacts before import
- Uses contact identifier for unique identification
- Optimized by fetching existing friends once
- Prevents duplicates in both import flows
- Gracefully skips already imported contacts

### State Management
- Uses `@State` for tracking selected contacts
- Maintains onboarding progress state
- Handles view transitions with animations
- Manages sheet presentation state
- Preserves selection state during search/filter

### Technical Considerations
- Performs contact access request handling
- Implements proper error handling
- Uses background thread for contact fetching
- Maintains SwiftData context for persistence
- Handles contact data synchronization

## User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for selections
- Smooth transitions between contacts
- Progress indication during bulk import
- Option to skip remaining contacts
- Search functionality for large contact lists

## Future Considerations
- Add batch size limits for large imports
- Implement undo/redo for import actions
- Add import progress indicators
- Consider fuzzy matching for duplicates
- Add merge functionality for duplicate handling
