# Friend Card UI Alignment Improvements

## Context
The friend card icons (location, frequency, and last seen) were not properly aligned, causing visual inconsistency in the UI. The text alignment was also not uniform across all elements.

## Changes Made
- Added fixed-width frames (15pt) for all icons in FriendListCard
- Centered icons within their containers
- Maintained consistent left alignment for all text elements
- Standardized spacing between icons and text

## Files Modified
- `ketchupsoon/Shared/Components/Cards/Specialized/FriendListCard.swift`

## Visual Impact
- Icons are now vertically aligned
- Text starts at a consistent position
- Improved overall visual hierarchy and readability
- Better professional appearance of friend cards

## Technical Details
Used SwiftUI's frame modifier with fixed width and center alignment to create consistent icon containers while preserving text alignment with HStack spacing.
