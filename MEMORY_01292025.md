# Calendar System Implementation Memory File
Date: January 29, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details, architecture decisions, and lessons learned while building the calendar system for the KetchupSoon app.

## Component Architecture

### 1. CalendarOverlayView
**Purpose**: Main calendar container and navigation hub
- Manages view mode switching (daily/list)
- Handles calendar service integration (Apple/Google)
- Controls navigation and date selection

**Key Features**:
- Toggle between daily and list views
- Date navigation and picker
- Calendar authorization handling
- Event loading and management

**State Management**:
```swift
@State private var selectedDate = Date()
@State private var events: [CalendarManager.CalendarEvent] = []
@State private var viewMode: DailyScheduleView.ViewMode = .daily
```

### 2. DailyScheduleView
**Purpose**: Handles event visualization in both daily and list formats

**Key Features**:
- Time-based grid layout
- Long press gesture for event creation
- Consistent event display across modes

**Technical Implementation**:
```swift
private let hourHeight: CGFloat = 60
private let timeWidth: CGFloat = 60
private let startHour = 7 // 7 AM
private let endHour = 24 // 11 PM
```

### 3. EventListItemView
**Purpose**: Reusable event display component

**Key Features**:
- Consistent event information layout
- Logo placement on right
- Standardized time and location formatting

**Styling Guidelines**:
- Right-aligned logo (24x24)
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 4. EventDetailView
**Purpose**: Detailed single event view

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive event information
- Convert to Ketchup functionality
- Friend picker integration

**Actions**:
- Event conversion
- Friend selection
- Schedule creation

### 5. FriendPickerView
**Purpose**: Friend selection interface

**Key Features**:
- Searchable friend list
- Selection binding
- Clean dismissal handling

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### 1. Visual Consistency
- Maintain consistent logo placement (right-aligned)
- Use standardized padding and spacing
- Keep consistent color schemes and styling

### 2. State Management
```swift
// Example of proper state cleanup
.sheet(isPresented: $showingScheduler, onDismiss: {
    selectedFriend = nil
}) {
    // Sheet content
}
```

### 3. Code Organization
- Break down complex views into components
- Use private subviews for organization
- Keep related functionality grouped

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Efficient event calculations
- Proper view updates
- Calendar operation optimization

## Future Improvements
1. Enhanced calendar sync options
2. More granular time selection
3. Additional event customization options

## Technical Debt
- None currently identified

## Notes
- Consistent logo placement was crucial for UX
- Calendar authorization requires careful handling
- State management needs attention for modal views
